# Pitcher-Luck
The voyage to find the pitchers of 2024 who got the luckiest and the unluckiest.

Graph 1: Showcases the distribution of hard hit rate + barrell rate against BABIP. What this does  is take a look at the pitchers who typically give up harder contact and pitches on the sweet spot. By plugging it against their BABIP it can tell us who is giving up a lot of hits when balls are in play and which pitchers are getting more outs.

Graph 2: This graph takes a look at the residual in comparison to the babip. This shows the points closer to the middle (0.00) are closer to their predicted with their observed BABIP. The pitchers on the far right have predicted BABIP's a lot lower than what was observed which could possible mean they are getting unlucky on the mound. The points on the far left are the pitchers who have predicted BABIPs that are a lot higher than what is observes meaning they are probably luckier on the balls in play. 

Graph 3: I'm checking my model to see if era and the residual I created for era matchup with my second graph as far as showcasing pitchers on further ends of the scatterplot. It's very similar results.

Graph 4: Takes a look at the difference in xERA and actual ERA and sees how it's distributed against ERA. What this does is check Graph 3 and make sure my residual model is accurate when testing whether pitchers are unlucky or not. 

Findings: From the graphs it looks like Ronel Blanco and Bryce Miller were the luckiest pitchers of 2024. They showed up on the far left side of all graphs showcasing how based on hitters contact they should be giving up more hits and have higher ERAs. As far as unlucky pitchers go, we have Jordan Montgomery and Tyler Mahle. Based on the data we can see they still aren't the best pitchers but based on xERA and the predicted points we got, they should be well under their observed points.

Why does this matter?
- This matters because there is always more than what meets the eye when looking at baseball games.
