Exploring the Luckiest and Unluckiest Pitchers of 2024

This analysis is focused on identifying which pitchers in 2024 have benefited from luck — or been hurt by misfortune — based on the contact quality of balls hit against them.

Graph 1: Hard-Hit & Barrel Rate vs. BABIP
This graph shows the relationship between how hard a pitcher is getting hit (using hard-hit rate + barrel rate) and their Batting Average on Balls in Play (BABIP). Pitchers who allow harder contact are expected to have higher BABIPs. Comparing these metrics helps reveal which pitchers are giving up more hits than expected — or getting outs despite poor contact quality.

Graph 2: Residuals vs. BABIP
Here, we compare the difference between predicted and actual BABIP (residuals). Points near zero indicate pitchers whose observed BABIP closely matches what's expected based on contact quality. Pitchers on the far right have much higher observed BABIPs than predicted — suggesting they’ve been unlucky. Those on the far left have lower observed BABIPs than expected, indicating potential good fortune.

Graph 3: ERA Residuals Check
This graph cross-validates the second one by looking at ERA and its residuals. We're checking whether the same "lucky" and "unlucky" pitchers stand out here too. The results are largely consistent with what we saw in Graph 2.

Graph 4: xERA vs. ERA Difference
This final graph compares the difference between expected ERA (xERA) and actual ERA, plotted against ERA itself. It serves as a further check on the reliability of the residuals model and reinforces whether a pitcher’s performance is due to skill or variance.

Findings:
The data suggests Ronel Blanco and Bryce Miller were among the luckiest pitchers in 2024 — consistently showing up on the far left in multiple graphs, meaning their stats likely overstate their performance. On the flip side, Jordan Montgomery and Tyler Mahle appear to be unlucky. While they’re not elite by any means, the models suggest they’ve been performing better than their surface-level stats (like ERA and BABIP) indicate.

Why It Matters:
Baseball is full of nuances, and raw stats don’t always tell the full story. By digging deeper into expected outcomes and actual results, we can better understand pitcher performance — and separate luck from skill.
